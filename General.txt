Today marks the end of what seems like a lifetime at Provident, bidding farewell after 16 years. It's certainly been interesting working here and I've been lucky enough to work with some great people along the way, as well as some rather quirky and challenging characters!! 

To those remaining, I wish you the all best in helping turn the company around. It is going to be challenging, but it wouldn't be Provident if it wasn't challenging!!

I’ve had the pleasure of working with and managing a brilliant team of DBA geeks over the last 14 years. For those moving onto pastures new, I hope your future is a bright one. For those remaining, you have my mobile number, I have reasonable contract rates for telephone support!!!

It's a daunting prospect of been unemployed for the first time in 30 years but I'm excited to find out what the future will bring (hopefully my lottery numbers will finally come good!). 

I wish you all the best for the future and hopefully our paths will cross again. 

Along with myself there is Paul, Mark and Rehan also leaving today from the DBS team, so we will be going for a couple of drinks at 4pm in Sunbridge Wells after work, for those that still owe me coffees (now beers) after not fulfilling your bribes!!

I have a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you who do not delete data. If you delete your data now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will delete your data.
